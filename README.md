## Abstract

How can you tell if a patient is the same person across all the different
electronic systems used in a hospital?

Can you be confident with messy data when lives are on the line?

Medical startup Luminare faced this challenge in a hospital setting and used
Clojure to save the day and make the nurses happy again.

This talk will explore the challenge of record linking: dealing with dirty data
sets, the pros and cons of different solution approaches, and using the
Felligi-Sunter method to create a probabilistic algorithm to match records.
